## Description

  *The what, why, and how:*

`PROJECT DESCRIPTION:` We were given some starter code (including pre-built HTML and some Javascript) and tasked with making the application functional. In order to do this, I had to create a few different files including a models folder, a routes folder (in conjunction with api.js), and a server.js file to kick off the application. The purpose of this Application is so that a user can log and track their excercises, and be returned four tables that display their data. The data is stored in a mongoDB database.


`WHO IS IT FOR?:` For those who want to be able to view create and track daily workouts and log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day.

 - *An issue I ran across in this project is the 'stats' tables. I did not write the starter code, so I'm not entirely sure why the tables skip days. I attempted to solve this problem however I was not able to fix it before the deadline.*
